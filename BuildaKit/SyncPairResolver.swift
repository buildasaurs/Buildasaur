            The resolving logic goes like this now. We have an array of integrations I for the latest commits.

            A1. true -> there are no integrations for this commit. kick one off! we're done.
            A2. false -> keep resolving (all references to "integrations" below mean only integrations of the current commit
            B. take all pending integrations, keep the most recent one, if it's there, cancel all the other ones.
            C. take the running integration, if it's there
            D. take all completed integrations
            
            resolve the status of the PR as follows
            
            E. is there a latest pending integration?
            E1. true -> status is ["Pending": "Waiting on the queue"]. also, if there's a running integration, cancel it.
            E2. false ->
            F. is there a running integration?
            F1. true -> status is ["Pending": "Integration in progress..."]. update status and do nothing else.
            F2. false ->
            G. are there any completed integrations?
            G1. true -> based on the result of the integrations create the PR status
            G2. false -> this shouldn't happen, print a very angry message.
